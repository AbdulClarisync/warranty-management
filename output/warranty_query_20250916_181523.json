Relevant sections may specify if this type of incident falls under \"defects,\" \"malfunctions,\" or \"manufacturer's responsibility.\" The search should also consider passages where replacement or repair of broken windows, under the circumstances provided by the user, is deemed \"coverable\" or \"claimable\" under the terms and conditions of the warranty.",
